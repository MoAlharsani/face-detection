# Face Detection
This repository contains Python code that uses OpenCV, Dlib, and NumPy to implement face detection. It draws a rectangle with the label "unknown" for faces that are not in the provided dataset. Otherwise, the name of the person will appear.

## Dataset
The model will load this as custom faces that will look for while the camera is running, you can add your custom faces at the 'data/known_faces/' directory.

## How It Works
There are two steps to have the model up and runniing, first you need to process the data and make it ready for the model. Processing data include
